sixth Challenge for Bootcamp in web-developing and UX
## Description

This was the sixth challenge for the University of Birmingham bootcamp in front-end web-developing and UX. In this challenge, I had to create a javaScript code quiz, which met the following requirements: 

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

This challenge was really fun but very difficult! It was the most challenging one yet and it was really good at testing my pseudocoding abilities, as I needed to break down the quiz step by step to be able to write code for each part correctly. 
## Usage

 All you need to do is open [this page](https://chantalcassinijones.github.io/code-quiz/) in your browser. Click on the start quiz buttonred button and take the quiz! Just make sure you keep an eye on the time, as if the timer reaches zero it is game over! After all questions have been answered, a final score will be displayed and you will have the option to add your initials and see your highscore.
